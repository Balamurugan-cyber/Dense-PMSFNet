# Dense-PMSFNet
ðŸ§  PMDFNet: Pyramidal Multi-scale Dense Fusion Network for Retinal Vessel and FAZ Segmentation
ðŸ©º Overview
This repository contains the implementation of PMDFNet, a deep learning architecture designed for the automatic segmentation of retinal blood vessels and the Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) from Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images.

PMDFNet leverages multi-scale pyramidal fusion, dense encoder connections, and attention-based decoding to achieve high-accuracy segmentation results â€” essential for early diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy, macular ischemia, and other vascular-related retinal disorders.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
To develop a deep learning-based solution that performs pixel-wise segmentation of retinal structures in OCTA images using a densely connected, multi-scale, and attention-enhanced network.

ðŸ“Š Key Features
ðŸ”— Dense Encoder using DenseNet-121 for rich feature reuse

ðŸ”º Pyramidal Multi-Scale Fusion Module (MSPFM) to capture both local and global features

ðŸ§  scSE Attention Blocks to focus on clinically relevant vessel regions

ðŸ”„ Deep Decoder with Fusion Layer for accurate reconstruction

âœ… High Dice and IoU Scores on OCTA-500 dataset
